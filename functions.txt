Python funcation definition:
A funcation is a block of reusable code that is used to perform a specific action. The advantages of using functions are.
1. Reducing duplication of code
2. Decomposing complex problem into simpler pieces
3. Improving clarity of the code
4. resuse of code
5. infomation hiding
Functions in Python are first-class citizens. It means that functions have equal status with other objects in Python. Functions can be assigned to variables, stored in collections, or passed as arguments. This brings additional flexibility to the language.

Python function types:
There are two basic types of functions: built-in functions and user defined functions. The built-in functions are part of the Python language; for instance dir(), len(), or abs(). The user defined functions are functions created with the def keyword.

Python creating fuction():
A function is created with def keyword. The statements in the block of the function must be inented.
def function():
    pass
The def keyword is followed by the function name with round brackets and a colon. The indented statements form a body of the function.

The function is later executed when needed. We say that we call the function. If we call a function, the statements inside the function body are executed. They are not executed until the function is called.

myfunc()
To call a function, we specify the function name with the round brackets.

Where to define funcations():
Functions can be defined inside a module, a class, or another function. Function defined inside a class is called a method.
