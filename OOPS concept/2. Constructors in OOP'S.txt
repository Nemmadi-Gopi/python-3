what is the  constructor?
#Constructor is nothing but just like a method and then first parameter as "self" in constructor.
#the "self" keyword which will holds the current class instance object.
syntax:

	def __init__(self):
		# body of the constructor

Types of constrctors:

we have two types of constructors
1. default constructor
2. paramaterized constructor

1. default constructor:
The default constructor is simple constructor which doesn’t accept any arguments.It’s definition has only one argument which is a reference to the instance being constructed.
class Student():		#creating the class with class variable
	student = " "		#class variable
	def __init__(self):	#defining a constructor
		self.student = "vissu" #creating an instance variable
	def std(self):		#defining the instance with std name
		print(self.student) #printing the self.student
s1 = Student() 			#creating an object of the class, it is called as initialize.
s1.std()			#calling the instance method using the object s1

Output: vissu

2. paramaterized constructor:
#A Constructor with parameters is known as parameterized constructor. The parameterized constructor takes its first argument as a reference to the instance being constructed known as self and the rest of the arguments are provided by the programmer.
example:
class student():							#creating a class as student
	class_name = "A1"						#declaring the class variables
	No_of_subject = 6
	#creating an constructor
	def __init__(self, name, age, s1, s2):
		self.name = name					# creating a instance variable
		self.age = age
		self.s1 = s1
		self.s2 = s2
	def std_details(self):						#declaring an instance method
		print("He is belonging to class section", self.class_name)#printing the instance variables
		print("he has to study", self.No_of_subject, "a year")
		print("name of the student is: ", self.name)
		print("He is ", self.age, "years old")
		print("he got ", self.s1, "Marks")
		print("he got ", self.s2, "Marks")
stde1 = student("vissu", 12, 99, 35)				#creating an object of the class, it is called as initialize.
stde2 = student("swamy", 13, 36, 99)				#creating an object of the class, it is called as initialize.
stde1.std_details()						#calling the instance method using the object s1
stde2.std_details()						#calling the instance method using the object s2

output: He is belonging to class section A1
he has to study 6 a year
name of the student is:  vissu
He is  12 years old
he got  99 Marks
he got  35 Marks
He is belonging to class section A1
he has to study 6 a year
name of the student is:  swamy
He is  13 years old
he got  36 Marks
he got  99 Marks
